# Object-Oriented Design

>  *Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a programming approach that involves
planning a system of interacting objects for the purpose of solving a software
problem.*

> * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-object-oriented-design/

---

# Definitions

- *Objects* include properties (or attributes) and methods that operate on those
properties.

- *Classes* provide the blueprint for an object. They define properties and
methods.

  * Example - BankAccount: 
    - properties = balance; account_number
    - methods = deposit; withdraw

- An object is an *instance* of a class.

- All data in python is represented by an object, e.g., strings, dictionaries, lists.

- The *constructor* is called when the class is instantiated.

# Syntax for defining classes

```python
class ClassName: # uses CapWords naming convention

    def __init__(self, initial_value):
        """
        Constructor.  
        """
        # initialize properties
        self.property = initial value


    def method(self, params):
        # accepts self as a parameter
        self.property += parameter 

```

---

# Syntax for instantiating classes and calling methods

```python

var_name = ClassName(constructor_params)

var_name.method(params)
```

---

# Using multiple files

- Multiple classes that are related may be grouped into a single .py file, but
classes may also be defined in different files.

- The `import` statement must be used to specify that you want to use a class
that is defined in a different file.

```python
from another_file import ClassName

```
